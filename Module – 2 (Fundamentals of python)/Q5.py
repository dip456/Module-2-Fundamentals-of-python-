"""ans :
The continue statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and 
move on to the next iteration. It is often used in loops (like for and while loops) to control the flow of the
 program.

When the continue statement is encountered within a loop, the remaining code inside the loop for the current 
iteration is skipped, and the loop proceeds to the next iteration.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the usage of continue:
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(f"Current value: {i}")
